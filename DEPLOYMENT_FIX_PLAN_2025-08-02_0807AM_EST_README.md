# Deployment Fix Applied - August 2, 2025 8:07 AM EST

## Fix Summary
Applied lazy initialization to services requiring API keys to prevent deployment crashes.

### Changes in commit 91e7da6:
1. Modified audioClipService.js to use lazy initialization
2. Updated voiceCloning.js routes for on-demand service creation
3. Updated dashboard.js routes with error handling
4. Removed diagnostic logs from index.js

### Root Cause:
Services were being instantiated during import phase before environment variables were available.

### Solution:
Services now initialize on first use, allowing environment variables time to load.

### Required Environment Variables:
- PORT=10000 (Critical for Render)
- ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- WS_PORT=10000
- METRICS_WS_PORT=10000

### Status:
✅ Fix implemented and pushed
⏳ Awaiting Render deployment trigger
