- Build command: `npm install && npm run build:vite-only`

### Podcast (podcast.repspheres.com) 
- GitHub repo: BoweryJG/podcast-repspheres
- Status: Building on Netlify (triggered by push)
- Build command: `npm run build`

### Canvas (canvas.repspheres.com)

## 📋 What to Check

1. **Netlify Dashboard** - Check build status for each app:
   - Look for green checkmarks indicating successful builds
   - If any fail, check build logs for errors

2. **Environment Variables** - Canvas showed missing env vars:
   - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
   - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   
   Set these in Netlify: Site Settings → Environment Variables

3. **CRM Pull Request** - Merge the luxury-transformation branch:
   - Review at: https://github.com/BoweryJG/crm/pull/new/luxury-transformation
   - Once merged, it will auto-deploy

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

Once all apps show as deployed in Netlify:

1. Clear all cookies/storage for repspheres.com
2. Go to https://repspheres.com and login
3. Navigate to each subdomain and verify auto-login works:
   - https://marketdata.repspheres.com
   - https://canvas.repspheres.com
   - https://podcast.repspheres.com
   - https://crm.repspheres.com (after PR merge)

## ⏱️ Estimated Time
- Netlify builds typically take 2-5 minutes each
- All apps should be deployed within 10-15 minutes
- CRM depends on when you merge the PR
